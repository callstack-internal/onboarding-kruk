# Onboarding App

Today we will be building a simple weather app using React Native.

The weather app will consist of two screens:

 - The first screen will display a list of cities. Each item in the list will display the name of the city, and some basic weather information (temperature, conditions).

 - The second screen will display additional details such as humidity, wind speed, and minimum/maximum temperatures for the day.

The app will look something like this when finished:

The app will use current weather data provided by the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

You should be able to demonstrate how to:

 - Setup and configuration of a basic React Native app (type it with either Flow or TypeScript)
 - Run a React Native app on a device
 - Write reusable, customizable React components
 - Compose multiple React components to build complex interfaces
 - Build lists in React Native
 - Fetch data from remote endpoints
 - Gracefully handle remote API errors
 - Navigate between multiple screens
